Pillow==6.2.0
six==1.14.0

# python-midi 0.2.2 is also required; however, the upstream repository
# still has an unmerged pull request fixing a significant tempo
# calculation bug:
#
#   https://github.com/vishnubob/python-midi/pull/6
#
# whereas my fork has the pull request already merged in:
#git+git://github.com/aspiers/python-midi.git#egg=midi;python_version<'3.0'
git+git://github.com/vishnubob/python-midi.git#egg=midi;python_version<'3.0'
git+git://github.com/vishnubob/python-midi.git@feature/python3#egg=midi;python_version>='3.0'

# Once https://github.com/pypa/pip/pull/526 is completed,
# this should work instead, for anyone who wants to
# concurrently hack on python-midi:
#-e git+git://github.com/aspiers/python-midi.git#egg=midi&subdirectory=src
